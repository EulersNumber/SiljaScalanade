The idea of the game is to participate in and complete a student Appro at a boat cruise on Silja Scalanade - the Queen of the Baltic Sea.
The player has a total of 40 moves to complete all the checkpoints (rastit) and simultaneously collect all 4 stamps (leima) on his checkpoint map (rastikartta)
This is a walktrough guide to complete the game as fast as possible (one example of such approach):

1: Get the map as soon as you spawn on the promenade (i.e., type "get map" while at the Promenade")
2: Examine the map to see what checkpoints and tasks you have to do and in which locations, use the map.png -file for navigation if necessary
3: Go north to the Karaoke Bar
4: Get the microphone (i.e., input "get microphone" while at the Karaoke Bar)
5: Sing Ukko Nooa (i.e., input "sing" while at the Karaoke Bar)
6: Go west to the Tax-Free shop
7: Buy souveniers for friends and family (i.e., input "souveniers" while at the Tax-Free shop)
8: Go south to the casino
9: Gamble (i.e., play Roulette) until you win (i.e., input "gamble" while at the Casino)
10: Go east to the Buffet Restaurant
11: Eat (i.e., input "eat" while at the Buffet Restaurant)
12: Optional but recommended: Confirm that you have indeed all the stamps collected (i.e., examine the map and verify this)
13: Go east to the cabin
14: You have now completed the Appro, congratulations!

There are some other things you can do that are not necessary to complete the appro, such as drink beer that you are carrying, put sample deodorant from Tax-Free on, gamble more than necessary, etc. Explore!
Furthermore, you can take detours as long as you stay within the limit of 40 moves.

Have fun, sailor!
